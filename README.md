# Grocery List App
The app displays a list of grocery items that a user can add to their own list. Users can input how much of an item they want to buy and navigate between activities to  
either see all items available or their own list. Users also have the ability to remove items from their list. List of user is saved internally through SharedPreferences, so closing and opening the app saves the users list of items.
